# sunnyside-landing-page

Very happy with how this one turned out. This was my first real attempt at responsive design without giving up. Still think there must be a better way
as im re-coding the entire styles for the page. may try REM on my next project to see if thid helps with responsivity automatically with the text and other objects

however overall everything went as expected and had fun playing with CSS grid a little more. Only issue is the small white line between the grid items. not
sure what is causing this, 

thanks
